CHANGELOG

16/5/17 - Nisal

Note 1:

K-nearest completed, returns a list of strings could not make it return an array, 
String[testing.size()]something  doesn't work. If we do String[]something = null then
the array is not pointing to anything, and we cannot add elements. I think why the first one doesnt work 
is because the size of the array has to be know at compile rather than run time in order to allocate
space in stack and testing.size() is not known at run time. Best way to get an array is to 
return an array list from k-nearest and use ".asArray" method to convert it to an array in the 
accuracy class. But this is a waste of time and memory -> it creates a new array and puts the elements 
in that array. This is good when we dont want to modify the orginal object (as we are no longer working 
with pointers) but in this case we dont care.  

Note 2:

Do we need member variables for k class as we pass the arguments to the methods anyway?
And the arguments changes based on which folds so the member variables are useless unless we create
multiple objects of k_neighbour with different sets of training and examples. Maybe we should just
initiate the class with k as it is the only constant.

Note 3: Naive Bayes

***Mean and Standard deviation***

Mean and Standard deviation values are needed for each attribute in each class as we are using the
probabilty distribution function. Example: 

Class | Attr1	| Att2	|...|Attr8
------|---------|-------|...|------|
Yes	  |Mean:0.8	|Mean..	|	|Mean..|
	  |Std:0.6	|Std..	|	|Std...|	
No	  |Mean:0.5	|Mean..	|	|Mean..|
	  |Std:0.3	|Std..	|	|Std...|	
	  
We can represent this in 4 arrays:

MeanYes[8] = {Attr1,...Attr8}
StdYes[8]  = {Attr1,...Attr8}
MeanNo[8]  = {Attr1,...Attr8}
StdNo[8]   = {Attr1,...Attr8}

And maybe we can put these arrays in 2 lists, 1 for each class.
